## Description 📌

This app prompts users, via the command line interface / terminal, to create a new employee. Based on the employee criteria and roles entered, a separate html file will then be dynamically generated to display employee cards created by the app.


### GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

      WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information

            THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

      WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML

            THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

      WHEN I click on the GitHub username

            THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

      WHEN I start the application

            THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

      WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

            THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

      WHEN I select the engineer option

            THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

      WHEN I select the intern option

            THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

      WHEN I decide to finish building my team

            THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated


## Installation 🛠

Be sure to initialize! Start the prompts by running 'node index.js' from the terminal.


## Usage 💻

Use this to satisfy the user story:

      "AS A manager
      I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
      SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles"
